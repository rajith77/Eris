/**
 * Represents a logical <i>Link</i> for sending messages to a destination within
 * the remote peer.
 * 
 * <h4>Creating message to send</h4> The application can use
 * {@link Messaging#message()} to create a message that can be used or sending.
 * To set the content use {@link Message#setContent(Object)}.
 * 
 * <h4>Tracking message delivery</h4> If the SenderMode is
 * {@link #AT_LEAST_ONCE} the application has two options for tracking
 * messages. <br>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Synchronously track messages by using {@link Tracker#awaitSettlement()}
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Ex:  
 * {@code sender.send(msg).awaitSettlement();} or <br>
 * {@code         
 * Tracker tracker = sender.send(msg);
 * .....
 * tracker.awaitSettlement();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </li>
 * <li>Receive completions asynchronously by registering a
 * {@link CompletionListener} with the Session using
 * {@link Session#setCompletionListener(CompletionListener)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h4>Exceptions</h4>
 * <ul>
 * <li>TransportException : Thrown when the underlying transport fails.</li>
 * <li>SenderException    : Thrown when the Sender gets to an erroneous state.</li>
 * <li>TimeoutException   : Thrown when an operation exceeds the connection timeout.</li>
