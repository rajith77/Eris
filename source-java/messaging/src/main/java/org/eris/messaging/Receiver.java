/**
 * 
 * Represents a logical <i>Link</i> for receiving messages from a message-source
 * within the remote peer.
 * 
 * <h4>Capacity And CreditMode</h4>
 * <b><i>Capacity</i></b> and <b><i>CreditMode</i></b> determines if and when
 * message credits are issued and whether or not messages should be prefetched.
 * 
 * <b><i>Capacity</i></b> is loosely defined as the upper limit for the number
 * of messages in the receiver's local queue at any given time. This is not a
 * hard limit. If the capacity is changed while messages are in flight the local
 * queue may end up with more messages than desired. Applications need to keep
 * this in mind.
 * 
 * <h4>How To Set CreditMode</h4>
 * The CreditMode can be specified using
 * {@link Session#createReceiver(String, ReceiverMode, CreditMode)}. If
 * {@link Session#createReceiver(String, ReceiverMode)} is used instead,
 * CreditMode defaults to {@link CreditMode#AUTO}
 * 
 * <h4>How To Set Capacity</h4>
 * When the Receiver is created the default capacity is determined based on it's
 * CreditMode. <br>
 * If {@link CreditMode#AUTO} is used it will be set to "1". This can be changed
 * via the system property "eris.receiver.capacity". <br>
 * If {@link CreditMode#EXPLICT} is used it will be set to "0".
 * 
 * Once the Receiver is created it can explicitly specify it's capacity using
 * {@link Receiver#setCapacity(int)}. The capacity can be any non negative
 * integer including zero.
 * 
 * <h4>How Message Credits Work</h4>
 * When the Receiver is created, <br>
 * If CreditMode is {@link CreditMode#AUTO}, "N" message credits will be issued
 * immediately, where "N" is the default capacity as determined above. <br>
 * If CreditMode is {@link CreditMode#EXPLICT} no message credits are issued.
 * 
 * When the application sets the capacity using
 * {@link Receiver#setCapacity(int)}, the library will issue a cancel for any
 * previously issued credits and re-issue credits as specified by the method. If
 * any messages were in flight before the peer sees the 'cancel' the receiver
 * will end up getting extra messages than intended.
 * 
 * If CreditMode is {@link CreditMode#AUTO}, the library will automatically
 * re-issue credits after a certain number of messages have been marked as
 * either accepted, rejected or released by the application. The library will
 * determine the optimum threshold for when the re-issue happens.
 * 
 * If CreditMode is {@link CreditMode#EXPLICT} the application needs to
 * explicitly manage it's message credit and use
 * {@link Receiver#setCapacity(int)} to issue credits when it is ready to
 * process messages.
 * 
 * <h4>Prefetch</h4>
 * If CreditMode is {@link CreditMode#AUTO}, the library will <i>prefetch</i> N
 * messages from the peer (if available) when the Receiver is created. Where N
 * is default capacity. To <b><i>disable prefetch</b></i>, you need to set
 * capacity to zero. The library will then attempt to receive messages on demand
 * when any of the receive methods are called.<br>
 * 
 * If CreditMode is {@link CreditMode#EXPLICT} no messages are prefetched.
 * Message delivery is started only when the application explicitly issues
 * credits.
 * 
 * <h4>Exceptions</h4>
 * <ul>
 * <li>TransportException : Thrown when the underlying transport fails.</li>
 * <li>ReceiverException  : Thrown when the Receiver gets to an erroneous state.</li>
 * <li>TimeoutException   : Thrown when an operation exceeds the connection timeout.</li>
 * </ul>
